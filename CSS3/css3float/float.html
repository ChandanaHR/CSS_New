        <p>Puppies are juvenile dogs, typically less than 12-18 months old, that are born dependent 
            on their mothers and develop rapidly. They are known for being playful, energetic, and social. 
            To thrive, puppies need careful feeding, training, and socialization, particularly between 8 and 12 weeks of age, 
            to develop healthy social behaviors with humans and other dogs.</p>
