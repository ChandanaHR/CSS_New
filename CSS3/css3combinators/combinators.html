        <h1>Abdul Kalam</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
            mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development 
            efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political 
            role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.</p>
            <p>Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President".</p>
            <section> <!--Descendant -->
                <p>He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
                <p>While delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. </p>
            </section>
        <p>Thousands attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. 
            A memorial was inaugurated near his home town in 2017.</p>

        <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence Research & Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence 
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist</p>

        <p>During his early career, he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[20] Later, he joined the Indian National Committee for Space Research, 
            working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai.</p>

        He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.
